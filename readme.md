## Suggested VSCode extensions

Following are suggested extensions to enable syntax highlighting and formating inside lit's `html` and `css` teplate string functions.

[lit-html](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html)
[es6-string-css](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bashmish.es6-string-css)

## Development workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` within `packages/core` to bundle in watch mode
2. Run `npm run dev` within `examples/html` to start local preview
3. Changes in `packages/core` are re-built automatically, so just refresh html example page to reflect them
